REPORT:
Question 1a.
Based on the figure, which data representation would you prefer for solving the 
classification problem and why?

Comment: Ans 1a. From the plotted figure HOG, HOG data representation is the best for solving
classification problem because it has more objects and and better distribution.

     
Question 1.c Function
Apply the resubstitution protocol to estimate the error rate of LDC for the three data representations. 
Give a comment on the result

1C Comment: Using Resubstitution to estimate the LDC error rate,
Show that the HOG data has the minimal amounts of error. Training and testing the 
HOG data LDC is better the other two data sets. 


Comment for 1D: 
Using Hold-out protocol for LDC also shows that the HOG data is best for
training and testing. The error rate for HOG data set is better than that for the other two data sets.

Comments for 1D:
Using oneR classifier to calculate the accuracy of the different data set.
The RGB data has the best accuracy and the error can be calculated by substracting the accuracy from 1. classification_errorRGB= 0.639




Comment for 2b.
From the output Z1 = 0.0.328 and Z2 = 0.3001. The closect point to the ideal point is Z2 which has y i.e sensitivity = 0.903 and 1-specificity = 0.284. From the plotted diagram it is the fifth matrics which values are given in the python code:


Comment for question 3 b
 From the result P1= 1.37 and P2 = 2.15: This implies that class1 has the shortest distance to the new object.
